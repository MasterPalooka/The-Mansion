# The-Mansion
This is the project of Nicholas Simo, Andrew Barecki and Marc-Anthony Pareira Figueredo
We will have our turtle build the house, 8x14x9.
The turtle will also add plenty of details to the house so it will not be a simple block.
The house will have features that are controlloed by computers.
The door will have a password that activates a redstone circuit to open the iron doors.
There will be a program that will turn the lights on and off.
Another program that will activate a turret to protect the house.
Lastly a computer on the first floor that will have a calculator program.
