# The-Mansion
This is the project of Nicholas Simo, Andrew Barecki and Marc-Anthony Pareira Figueredo
We will have our turtle build the floor, 8x14
Our turtle will build the walls and a beatiful ceiling. After that we will have a computer around the house and use redstone to add additional functions to the house. The main doors will need a password to open it and it use redstone to perform that function. Upcoming changes will be updated immediatly.
